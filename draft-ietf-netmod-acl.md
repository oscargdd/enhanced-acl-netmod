--- abstract

RFC 8519 defines a YANG data model for Access Control Lists
(ACLs). This document discusses a set of extensions that fix many of
the limitations of the ACL model as initially defined in RFC 8519.

# Introduction
{{!RFC8519}} defines Access control lists (ACLs) as a
user-ordered set of filtering rules. The model targets the
configuration of the filtering behaviour of a device. However, the
model structure, as defined in {{!RFC8519}}, suffers from a set of limitations. This
document describes these limitations and proposes an enhanced ACL
structure. The YANG module in this document is solely based
on augmentations to the ACL YANG module defined in {{!RFC8519}}.

The motivation of such enhanced ACL structure is discussed in detail in {{ps}}.

When managing ACLs, it is common for network operators to group
match elements in pre-defined sets. The consolidation into group matches
allows for reducing the number of rules, especially in large scale
networks. If it is needed, for example, to find a match against 100
IP addresses (or prefixes), a single rule will suffice rather than creating
individual Access Control Entries (ACEs) for each IP address (or prefix). In
doing so, implementations would optimize the performance of matching
lists vs multiple rules matching.

The enhanced ACL structure is also meant to facilitate the management of
network operators. Instead of entering the IP address or port number
literals, using user-named lists decouples the creation of the rule
from the management of the sets. Hence, it is possible to remove/add
 entries to the list without redefining the (parent) ACL
rule.

In addition, the notion of Access Control List (ACL) and defined sets
 is generalized so that it is not device-specific as per {{!RFC8519}}.  ACLs
 and defined sets may be defined at network / administrative domain level
 and associated to devices. This approach facilitates the reusability across multiple
  network elements. For example, managing the IP prefix sets from a network
   level makes it easier to maintain by the security groups.

Network operators maintain sets of IP prefixes that are related to each other,
e.g., deny-lists or accept-lists that are associated with those provided by a
 VPN customer. These lists are maintained and manipulated by security expert teams.


Note that ACLs are used locally in devices but are triggered by other
tools such as DDoS mitigation {{?RFC9132}} or BGP Flow Spec {{?RFC8955}}
{{!RFC8956}}. Therefore, supporting means to easily map to the filtering rules conveyed in
messages triggered by  these tools is valuable from a network operation standpoint.

# Terminology

The keywords **MUST**, **MUST NOT**, **REQUIRED**, **SHALL**, **SHALL NOT**, **SHOULD**,
**SHOULD NOT**, **RECOMMENDED**, **MAY**, and **OPTIONAL**, when they appear in this
document, are to be interpreted as described in {{!RFC2119}}.

The terminology for describing YANG modules is defined in {{!RFC7950}}.
The meaning of the symbols in the tree diagrams is defined in
{{?RFC8340}}.


In addition to the terms defined in {{!RFC8519}}, this document makes use of the following terms:

- Defined set: Refers to reusable description of one or multiple information elements (e.g., IP address, IP prefix, port number, or ICMP type).

# Problem Statement & Gap Analysis {#ps}

## Suboptimal Configuration: Lack of Support for Lists of Prefixes {#ps-sets}

IP prefix related data nodes, e.g., "destination-ipv4-network" or
   "destination-ipv6-network", do not support handling a list of IP
   prefixes, which may then lead to having to support large numbers of ACL entries in a configuration file.

The same issue
is encountered when ACLs have to be in place to mitigate DDoS
attacks (e.g., {{?RFC9132}} when a set of sources are involved in such
an attack. The situation is even worse when both a list of sources
and destination prefixes are involved.

{{example}} shows an example of the required ACL configuration for filtering traffic from two prefixes.

Such a configuration is suboptimal for both:

- Network controllers that
   need to manipulate large files.  All or a subset for this
   configuration will need to be passed to the underlying network
   devices
- Devices may receive such a configuration and thus will need to maintain it locally.

## Manageability: Impossibility to Use Aliases or Defined Sets

The same approach as the one discussed for IP prefixes can be generalized by introducing the concept of "aliases" or "defined sets".

The defined sets are reusable definitions across several ACLs. Each category is modelled in YANG as a list of parameters related to the class it represents. The following sets can be considered:

-  Prefix sets: Used to create lists of IPv4 or IPv6 prefixes.
-  Protocol sets: Used to create a list of protocols.
-  Port number sets: Used to create lists of TCP or UDP port values
      (or any other transport protocol that makes uses of port numbers).
      The identity of the protocols is identified by the protocol set, if
      present.  Otherwise, a set applies to any protocol.
-  ICMP sets: Uses to create lists of ICMP-based filters. This applies only when the protocol is set to ICMP or ICMPv6.

A candidate structure is shown in {{example_sets}}:

Aliases may also be considered to managed resources that are identified by a combination of various parameters as shown in the candidate tree in {{example_alias}}.
Note that some aliases can be provided by decomposing them into separate sets.

## Bind ACLs to Devices, Not Only Interfaces

In the context of network management, an ACL may be enforced in many
   network locations.  As such, the ACL module should allow for binding an
   ACL to multiple devices, not only (abstract) interfaces.

The ACL name must, thus, be unique at the scale of the network, but the same name may be used in many devices when enforcing node-specific ACLs.

## Partial or Lack of IPv4/IPv6 Fragment Handling {#ps-frag}

{{!RFC8519}} does not support fragment handling capability for IPv6 but
offers a partial support for IPv4 by means of 'flags'.  Nevertheless,
the use of 'flags' is problematic since it does not allow a bitmask
to be defined.  For example, setting other bits not covered by the
'flags' filtering clause in a packet will allow that packet to get
through (because it won't match the ACE).

Defining a new IPv4/IPv6 matching field called 'fragment' is thus required to efficiently handle fragment-related filtering rules.

## Suboptimal TCP Flags Handling {#ps-flags}

{{!RFC8519}} supports including flags in the TCP match fields, however
   that structure does not support matching operations as those
   supported in BGP Flow Spec.  Defining this field to be defined as a
   flag bitmask together with a set of operations is meant to
   efficiently handle TCP flags filtering rules.


## Rate-Limit Action {#ps-rate}

 {{!RFC8519}} specifies that forwarding actions can be 'accept' (i.e., accept matching
   traffic), 'drop' (i.e., drop matching traffic without sending any
   ICMP error message), or 'reject' (i.e., drop matching traffic and send an ICMP error message to the source). However, there are situations where the matching traffic can be accepted, but with a rate-limit policy. Such capability is not currently supported by {{!RFC8519}}.

## Payload-based Filtering {#ps-pf}

Some transport protocols use existing protocols (e.g., TCP or UDP) as substrate. The match criteria for such protocols may rely upon the 'protocol' under 'l3', TCP/UDP match criteria, part of the TCP/UDP payload, or a combination thereof. {{!RFC8519}} does not support matching based on the payload.

Likewise, the current version of the ACL model does not support filtering of encapsulated traffic.

## Reuse the ACLs Content Across Several Devices

Having a global network view of the ACLs is highly valuable for service providers. An ACL could be defined and applied
following the hierarchy of the network topology. So, an ACL can be
defined at the network level and, then, that same ACL can be used (or referenced to)
in several devices (including termination points) within the same network.

This network/device ACLs differentiation introduces several new
requirements, e.g.:

* An ACL name can be used at both network and device levels.
* An ACL content updated at the network level should imply
  a transaction that updates the relevant content in all the nodes using this
  ACL.
* ACLs defined at the device level have a local meaning for the specific node.
* A device can be associated with a router, a VRF, a
  logical system, or a virtual node. ACLs can be applied in physical and
  logical infrastructure.

## Defined sets

The augmented ACL structure includes several containers to manage reusable sets of elements that can be matched in an ACL entry.
Each set is uniquely identified by a name, and can be called from the relevant entry. The following sets are defined:

* IPv4 prefix set: It contains a list of IPv4 prefixes. A match will be considered if the IP address (source or destination, depending on the ACL entry) is contained in any of the prefixes.
* IPv6 prefix set: It contains a list of IPv6 prefixes. A match will be considered if the IP address (source or destination, depending on the ACL entry) is contained in any of the prefixes.
* Port sets: It contains a list of port numbers to be used in TCP / UDP entries. The ports can be individual port numbers, a range of ports, and an operation.
* Protocol sets: It contains a list of protocol values. Each protocol can be identified either by a number (e.g., 17) or a name (e.g., UDP).
* ICMP sets: It contains a list of ICMP types, each of them identified by a type value, optionally the code and the rest of the header.

## TCP Flags Handling

The augmented ACL structure includes a new leaf 'flags-bitmask' to better handle flags.

Clients that support both 'flags-bitmask' and 'flags' matching fields MUST NOT set these fields in the same request.

{{example_4}} shows an example of a request to install a filter to discard incoming TCP messages having all flags unset.

## Fragments Handling

The augmented ACL structure includes a new leaf 'fragment' to better handle fragments.

Clients that support both 'fragment' and 'flags' matching fields MUST NOT set these fields in the same request.

{{example_2}} shows the content of a POST request to allow the traffic destined to 198.51.100.0/24 and UDP port number 53, but to drop all fragmented
packets.  The following ACEs are defined (in this order):

* "drop-all-fragments" ACE: discards all fragments.
* "allow-dns-packets" ACE: accepts DNS packets destined to 198.51.100.0/24.

{{example_3}} shows an example of the body of a POST request to allow the traffic destined to 2001:db8::/32 and UDP port number 53, but to drop all fragmented packets. The following ACEs are defined (in this order):

* "drop-all-fragments" ACE: discards all fragments (including atomic fragments). That is, IPv6 packets that include a Fragment header (44) are dropped.
* "allow-dns-packets" ACE: accepts DNS packets destined to 2001:db8::/32.

## Rate-Limit Traffic

In order to support rate-limiting (see {{ps-rate}}), a new action called "rate-limit" is defined.

# Security Considerations (TBC)

The YANG modules specified in this document define a schema for data
   that is designed to be accessed via network management protocol such
   as NETCONF {{!RFC6241}} or RESTCONF {{!RFC8040}}.  The lowest NETCONF layer
   is the secure transport layer, and the mandatory-to-implement secure
   transport is Secure Shell (SSH) {{!RFC6242}}.  The lowest RESTCONF layer
   is HTTPS, and the mandatory-to-implement secure transport is TLS
   {{!RFC8446}}.

The Network Configuration Access Control Model (NACM) {{!RFC8341}} provides the means to restrict access for particular NETCONF or RESTCONF users to a preconfigured subset of all available NETCONF or RESTCONF protocol operations and content.

There are a number of data nodes defined in this YANG module that are writable/creatable/deletable (i.e., config true, which is the default). These data nodes may be considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network environments. Write operations (e.g., edit-config) to these data nodes without proper protection can have a negative effect on network operations. These are the subtrees and data nodes and their sensitivity/vulnerability:

- TBC

Some of the readable data nodes in this YANG module may be considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network environments. It is thus important to control read access (e.g., via get, get-config, or notification) to these data nodes. These are the subtrees and data nodes and their sensitivity/vulnerability:

- TBC
